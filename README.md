AI-ML Projects Collection
Welcome to the AI-ML repository! This repo contains several machine learning projects covering regression, clustering, and classification tasks using Python. Each project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insights.

Projects Overview
1. Student Score Prediction üéì
Predicts students' exam scores based on lifestyle and academic features such as study hours, attendance, sleep, exercise frequency, and mental health ratings.

Techniques: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression

Dataset: Kaggle - Student Academic Performance Analysis

Goal: Build a regression model to estimate exam scores and analyze feature impact.

2. Mall Customer Segmentation üõçÔ∏è
Clusters mall customers into distinct groups based on annual income and spending score for targeted marketing.

Techniques: K-Means Clustering, DBSCAN

Dataset: Kaggle - Mall Customers

Goal: Identify meaningful customer segments and detect outliers for personalized campaigns.

3. Forest Cover Type Classification üå≤
Classifies forest cover types into 7 categories using environmental and cartographic data.

Techniques: Random Forest, XGBoost (with hyperparameter tuning)

Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Covertype

Goal: Build a high-accuracy classifier for ecological mapping and resource planning.

4. Loan Approval Prediction üí∞
Predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on financial and personal information. Handles class imbalance using SMOTE.

Techniques: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest (tuned)

Dataset: Kaggle - Loan Approval Prediction

Goal: Develop a robust model to support loan approval decisions.
